# Prime number generator

Have you ever wanted to know how many primes are in range from 0 to 6000000000?

Me neither.

Still, you can do it with my program.

## Dependencies

To run stable release you need Java Runtime Environment 8 (8u121).

To compile it yourself you will need Java Development Kit 8 (8u121) and Maven 3.3.3 or above.

This program may run on older versions of Java, but it should be ran on those listed above.

## How to run

You can either play this game by typing these commands in Linux terminal:
```
git clone https://github.com/Open96/PrimeNumberGenerator.git
cd PrimeNumberGenerator
mvn clean install
java -jar target/prime-number-generator-1.1-SNAPSHOT.jar <There you have to specify upper range>
```
Above commands will download code from that repository into your computer and compile it.


Or you can download latest release from [here](https://github.com/Open96/PrimeNumberGenerator/releases). In this situation all you need to do is open a .jar file.
